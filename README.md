# Portfolio — Nadia Hemati

A responsive and accessible personal portfolio website built with pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

It highlights my work as a Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer, featuring live project links, Figma prototypes, 
and an interactive dark mode toggle.

Designed with performance, simplicity, and usability in mind — this site demonstrates clean structure, semantic code, 
and modern web techniques.
